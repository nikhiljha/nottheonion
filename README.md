Can you tell if the article is fake or not? Find out at the onion bot!

## What is it?

This is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot that sends you titles of posts from the subreddits [/r/TheOnion](http://reddit.com/r/TheOnion) and [/r/nottheonion](http://reddit.com/r/nottheonion). The goal of the game is to guess what subreddit it's from. TheOnion has all fake news articles, and nottheonion has all real news articles.

## Install

I'm always running the latest and greatest copy over here, but if you want to install, here you go!

You will need the following things installed for this to work.
 * Python 2.7 (Initial Install Only)
 * npm
 * nodejs

Then just run all of these commands! :+1:

```
git clone https://github.com/nikhiljha/nottheonion.git
cd nottheonion
npm install
```

then make a file called telegram.token with ONLY your telegram token in it. NO NEW LINE, NO EXTRA SPACES.

to run just do `node start.js`

and you're done! That wasn't so hard, was it?
